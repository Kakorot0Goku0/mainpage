        <p> Clinton Barton was the younger of two sons born to a small business proprietor and his wife. When his parents were killed in an automobile accident when he was eight, Barton and his brother were placed in the state orphanage. At fourteen, Clint and Barney Barton ran away from the institute to join a traveling carnival. There Clint Barton apprenticed himself to the carnival's star attraction, the mysterious rogue known only as the Swordsman. Recognizing Clint's natural flair for archery, the Swordsman agreed to tutor him in the art. (Barney Barton was relegated to menial work.)For eight hours every day for four years, the younger Barton practiced with bow and arrow, soon becoming good enough to perform professionally as a trick shooter under the name of Hawkeye the Marksman. When Barton was eighteen, he accidentally discovered that his mentor was stealing from the carnival management. When the boy refused to become his partner in crime, the Swordsman chased Barton up onto a tightrope and cut it out from under him. The Swordsman left him for dead and fled the carnival. Found by his brother Barney, Clint Barton was rushed to a hospital and eventually recovered from the compound fractures to his legs. A year later, he rejoined the carnival and resumed his act.</p>

    <p>Hawkeye wields a number of custom-made bows, and carries a quiver containing various gadget-laden "trick" arrows.
        Hawkeye uses a wide variety of arrows, many of which are custom-built with devices to enhance their effectiveness in crimefighting. Hawkeye's quiver has the capacity to carry 36 arrows. Twelve of the 36 arrows have standard target-point arrowheads, six have 3-bladed broadheads, and the remaining eighteen have various custom tips. Hawkeye has recently developed a modular arrowhead system whereby certain custom arrowheads can be attached to the shafts of any standard target-point arrow to convert them for special use. These arrowheads are stored in compartments on his tunic-belts. Although.
        Some of Hawkeye's more technological custom arrows were designed and built by Anthony Stark. Hawkeye himself designed the majority of his custom arrows. To aid Hawkeye in locating the appropriate arrow with speed and accuracy, he has not only arranged the arrows in his quiver in a set pattern, he has also notch-coded the hock of each arrow so he can tell by touch which arrow he is drawing. Hawkeye is constantly modifying his arsenal of arrows.</p>
